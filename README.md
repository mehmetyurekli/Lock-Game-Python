# Lock Game Python
 A board game I coded for a school project

 Game Description:

 Lock game is a strategy game played with 2 people. The playing field is 8X8 and consists of 64 squares. In the game, both players have 8 stones. The object of the game is to remove all the opponent's stones. reduce the number of opponent's stones below 2.

At the beginning of the game, players place their stones on the squares in the row closest to them. Then the players take turns trying to lock the opponent's stones by moving a stone of their own. The stones can be moved as far as desired horizontally or vertically within the playing field, but the stones cannot be jumped over.

A stone with opponent’s stones on 2 adjacent squares horizontally, a stone with opponent’s stones on 2 adjacent squares vertically, or a stone in the corner with opponent’s stones on the adjacent squares horizontally and vertically is considered locked. If the player whose turn locks any
opponent’s stones as a result of his/her move, he/she takes that stones out. The player can't suicide. (going inbetween two opponent stones)

The player who succeed to remove all the opponent's stones wins the game.
